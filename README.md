<img src="http://elixir-lang.org/images/learning/elixir-school.jpg" width="120px"/>

Elixir-School is an open and community driven effort inspired by Twitter’s Scala School. The site’s content consists of peer-reviewed lessons on various Elixir topics that range in difficulty. The lessons are currently available in over 10 languages to help make programming Elixir more accessible to non-English speakers.

In this book, you will find descriptions of programs that you can write in Elixir. The programs will usually be short, and each one has been designed to provide practice material for a particular Elixir programming concept. These programs have not been designed to be of considerable difficulty, though they may ask you to stretch a bit beyond the immediate material and examples that you find in the book Introducing Elixir.

###[Elixir Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/elixir-cookbook)

<img src="https://d1ldz4te4covpm.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/3964_Elixir%20Cookbook_Cover_1.jpg" width="120px"/>

This book is a set of recipes grouped by topic that acts as a good reference to get ideas from or to quickly search for a solution to a problem. You will begin by launching an IEx session and using it to test some ideas. Next, you will perform various operations like loading and compiling modules, inspecting your system, generating a supervised app, and so on. Furthermore, you will be introduced to immutability, working with data structures, performing pattern matching, and using stream modules to generate infinite data sequences. You will learn about everything from joining strings to determining the word frequency in text. With respect to modules and functions, you will also discover how to load code from other modules and use guards and pattern matching in functions.

###[Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action)

Elixir in Action teaches you how to solve practical problems of scalability, concurrency, fault tolerance, and high availability using Elixir. You'll start with the language, learning basic constructs and building blocks. Then, you'll learn to think about problems using Elixir's functional programming mindset. With that solid foundation, you'll confidently explore Elixir's seamless integration with BEAM and Erlang's powerful OTP framework of battle-tested abstractions you can use immediately. Finally, the book provides guidance on how to distribute a system over multiple machines and control it in production.

The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook gets you started programming applications with Elixir and OTP. You begin with a quick overview of the Elixir language syntax, along with just enough functional programming to use it effectively. Then, you'll dive straight into OTP and learn how it helps you build scalable, fault-tolerant and distributed applications through several fun examples. Come rediscover the joy of programming with Elixir and remember how it feels like to be a beginner again.

###[Learning Elixir](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-elixir)

<img src="https://d255esdrn735hr.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/B04907_MockupCover_Normal.jpg" width="120px"/>

Elixir, based on Erlang’s virtual machine and ecosystem, makes it easier to achieve scalability, concurrency, fault tolerance, and high availability goals that are pursued by developers using any programming language or programming paradigm. Elixir is a modern programming language that utilizes the benefits offered by Erlang VM without really incorporating the complex syntaxes of Erlang.

###[Programming Elixir 1.2](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir12/programming-elixir-1-2)

<img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zIU2fU2KL._SX415_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="120px"/>

You want to explore functional programming, but are put off by the academic feel (tell me about monads just one more time). You know you need concurrent applications, but also know these are almost impossible to get right. Meet Elixir, a functional, concurrent language built on the rock-solid Erlang VM. Elixir’s pragmatic syntax and built-in support for metaprogramming will make you productive and keep you interested for the long haul. This book is the introduction to Elixir for experienced programmers.

###[Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good](http://learnyousomeerlang.com)

<img src="https://www.nostarch.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/product_main_page/erlang_newsmall.png" width="120px"/>

Hey there! This is Learn You Some Erlang for great good! This book is for you if you’ve got some programming experience and if you’re not too familiar with functional programming. It can still be useful if you’re too good for that, as we progressively go into more and more advanced topics.

###[Metaprogramming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir)

<img src="http://elixir-lang.org/images/learning/metaprogramming-elixir.jpg" width="120px"/>

Write code that writes code with Elixir macros. Macros make metaprogramming possible and define the language itself. In this book, you’ll learn how to use macros to extend the language with fast, maintainable code and share functionality in ways you never thought possible. You’ll discover how to extend Elixir with your own first-class features, optimize performance, and create domain-specific languages.

###[Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do)

###[Erlang In Anger](http://www.erlang-in-anger.com/)

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/erlang-in-anger/book-cover.png" width="120px"/>

This book intends to be a little guide about how to be the Erlang medic in a time of war. It is first and foremost a collection of tips and tricks to help understand where failures come from, and a dictionary of different code snippets and practices that helped developers debug production systems that were built in Erlang.

###[Building Scalable Applications with Erlang](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Scalable-Applications-Developers-Library/dp/0321636465?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0)

Erlang is emerging as a leading language for concurrent programming in mission-critical enterprise environments where applications must deliver exceptional reliability, availability, and scalability. It’s already used by organizations ranging from Facebook to Amazon, and many others are adopting or considering it.
As a functional language, however, Erlang is radically different from conventional object-oriented languages like C++ and Java. This book quickly brings experienced object-oriented programmers up to speed with both Erlang and the principles of functional programming. Jerry Jackson thoroughly explains Erlang’s key concepts, principles, and features, bridging the conceptual gaps that often frustrate object developers. Next, he shows how to use Erlang to build massively-scalable real-world systems with up to “nine nines” availability: that is, up to 99.9999999% uptime.
