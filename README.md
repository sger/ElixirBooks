Adoption is more than programming. Elixir is an exciting new language, but to successfully get your application from start to finish, you’re going to need to know more than just the language. You need the case studies and strategies in this book. Learn the best practices for the whole life of your application, from design and team-building, to managing stakeholders, to deployment and monitoring. Go beyond the syntax and the tools to learn the techniques you need to develop your Elixir application from concept to production.

This book is a set of recipes grouped by topic that acts as a good reference to get ideas from or to quickly search for a solution to a problem. You will begin by launching an IEx session and using it to test some ideas. Next, you will perform various operations like loading and compiling modules, inspecting your system, generating a supervised app, and so on. Furthermore, you will be introduced to immutability, working with data structures, performing pattern matching, and using stream modules to generate infinite data sequences. You will learn about everything from joining strings to determining the word frequency in text. With respect to modules and functions, you will also discover how to load code from other modules and use guards and pattern matching in functions.

This book quickly brings experienced object-oriented programmers up to speed with both Erlang and the principles of functional programming. Jerry Jackson thoroughly explains Erlang’s key concepts, principles, and features, bridging the conceptual gaps that often frustrate object developers. Next, he shows how to use Erlang to build massively-scalable real-world systems with up to “nine nines” availability: that is, up to 99.9999999% uptime.
